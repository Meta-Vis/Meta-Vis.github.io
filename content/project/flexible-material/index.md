## Product Introduction
![](overview.png "Overview of the system")
The flexible material high-precision inspection system consists of four main components: 
- high-transmission light sources
- high-resolution line-scan cameras
- simple and easy-to-install mechanical structures
- highly stable system software


![](anomaly.png "Examples of detected defects")

The system is mainly used for high-precision defect detection of flexible materials. 
It combines deep learning AI algorithms and traditional algorithms to accurately detect fine defects as small as **10um**. 
It is suitable for **quality control** and **product rewinding** on **flexible printing production lines**.

## Application Scenarios
